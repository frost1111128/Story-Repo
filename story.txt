A story by Sam Hogenson

There once was a programer who forgot his password. What was he to do?
 He had not written it down. But luckly...

This clumsy programmer was still a programmer after all and he could use 
his coding skills to obtain his password. He decided to code a brute 
force algorythm inorder to gain back his password. After the brute force 
ran a total of 1209382109 times, he finally got his password back. Since 
he was able to gain back his password so easily, he decided to enable 
multi-factor authorization so nobody could break into his account, and 
so he would have a way to recover his password.
